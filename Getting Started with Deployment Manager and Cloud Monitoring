# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring

## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	- Create a Deployment Manager deployment.

	- Update a Deployment Manager deployment.

	- View the load on a VM instance using Cloud Monitoring.

## Steps

Prior to the lab. ensure that the following APIs are enabled in the APIs and Services menu:

	- Cloud Deployment Manager v2 API

	- Cloud Runtime Configuration API

	- Cloud Monitoring API

1. Create a Deployment Manager deployment

	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
	
     1. Download an editable Deployment Manager template:
     
        	gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfcoreinfra/mydeploy.yaml mydeploy.yaml
        	
      2. Use the sed command to replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform project ID using this command:
      
      	sed -i -e "s/PROJECT_ID/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" mydeploy.yaml
      	
      3. Use the sed command to replace the ZONE placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform zone using this command:
      
      	sed -i -e "s/ZONE/$MY_ZONE/" mydeploy.yaml
      	
      4. Build a deployment from the template:
      
      	gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml
      	
2. Update a Deployment Manager deployment.

      1. Launch the nano text editor to edit the mydeploy.yaml file:
      
      	nano mydeploy.yaml
      	
      2. Find the line that sets the value of the startup script, value: "apt-get update", and edit it so that it looks like this:
      
      	      value: "apt-get update; apt-get install nginx-light -y"
      	      
      	   **Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file.**

	   **Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.**
	   
3. View the load on a VM instance using Cloud Monitoring.

SSH to my-vm instance.

       1. Execute this command to create a CPU load:
       
       	dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null &
       	
       2. Terminate your workload generator
       	
       	kill %1
