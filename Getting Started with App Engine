# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives

	- Initialize App Engine.

	- Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	- Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	- Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
	
## Steps

1. Initialize App Engine
   
     1. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
		
    2. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
    	
    	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
    	
    3. Navigate to the source directory
    
    	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
  
     1. Download and update package list
     
  	sudo apt-get update
  	
     2. Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
     	
     	sudo apt-get install virtualenv
     	
    	virtualenv -p python3 venv
    	
    	
    3. Activate the virtual environment.
    
    	source venv/bin/activate
    	
    4. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
    	
    	pip install  -r requirements.txt
    	
    5. Run the application
    
    	python main.py
    	
    	**In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.**
    
    6. Press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service in cloud shell.
    
3.  Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
     
    1. Navigate to the source directory:
    
    	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
    	
    2. Deploy your Hello World application
    
    	gcloud app deploy
    	
    3. Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

	gcloud app browse
	
	**paste the URL on your browser window**
	
4. Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

	- In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.
	
	- Click Disable application.
	
	- Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
